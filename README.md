Title: Expectancy Maintenance Shapes Context-Based Impression Formation

Manuscript Authors: Lisa M. Huang & Jeffrey W. Sherman

Abstract:
People’s attempts to maintain consistency in their impressions of others often result in information processing that is biased toward expectancy maintenance. In this research, we examined one process by which people maintain expectancies of an individual when that individual is observed across multiple contexts – by generalizing an expectancy-congruent impression across contexts but contextualizing an expectancy-incongruent impression to the unique context in which expectancy-incongruent behaviors are observed. Across four experiments, we show that people engage in these expectancy maintenance processes when forming impressions of individuals and group members, and we show how these processes differentially affect impression strength across contexts. We also explored whether impressions can be changed. We discuss the implications of this research for stereotyping and attitude change.

Outline of Experiments:
- Experiment 1 examined how trait expectations of an individual target person influence context-based impression formation and, specifically, whether they lead participants to form impressions in ways that support expectancy maintenance. As predicted, participants generalized the expectancy-congruent impression of the target when he was encountered in new contexts, but they contextualized the expectancy-incongruent impression into the unique context in which it was learned. The results also showed that participants had formed a stronger expectancy-incongruent impression in the process of forming the context-based impressions, possibly as a result of attending more to the context when observing expectancy-incongruent behaviors. Even though the incongruent impression was contextualized to a single context, that impression was especially strong.
- Experiment 2 examined whether expectancies based on group stereotypes influence context-based impression formation in a similar manner as do individual target expectancies. Contrary to predictions, participants did not generalize the stereotype-congruent impression, nor did they contextualize the stereotype-incongruent impression. However, there is some evidence suggesting that participants did form a stronger expectancy-incongruent impression. 
- Experiment 3, like Experiment 2, examined whether expectancies based on group stereotypes influence context-based impression formation, except that it used a stronger stereotype manipulation. In this experiment, participants did generalize the stereotype-congruent impression and contextualized the stereotype-incongruent impression, consistent with our hypotheses. However, they did not form a stronger stereotype-incongruent impression. Experiment 3 also explored how impressions of an individual group member translate to impressions of another member of the same group and to a member of a different group when they are encountered in the same contexts. The results did, in fact, show that context-based impressions transferred to an ingroup and an outgroup member, but only when those individuals were encountered in a counter-stereotypic context. In all other contexts, participants held impressions of the ingroup and outgroup targets that were consistent with the stereotypes of their respective groups. 
- Experiments 4a and 4b examined whether participants would change their impressions if the frequency of an individual’s behaviors do not accurately reflect their initial expectations. Overall, participants did change their impressions—at least partially—when the target’s behavioral pattern did not match their original expectations. As such, they were less likely to generalize the expectancy-congruent impression and less likely to contextualize the expectancy-incongruent impression, demonstrating that impressions are amenable to change. However, the participants did not fully adjust their impressions away from original expectancies, so it is not clear if the effects of expectancies can be eliminated entirely.
